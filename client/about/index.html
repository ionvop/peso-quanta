                        Welcome to Peso Quanta!<br>
                        <br>
                        At Peso Quanta, we are passionate about creating innovative solutions that make life easier for small business owners in the Philippines, particularly those in rural areas. Our flagship product, the Peso Quanta mobile application, is designed to simplify the process of counting and tracking sales from pisonet machines by using advanced image recognition technology.<br>
                        <br>
                        Our Mission Our mission is to provide a practical and affordable solution for pisonet operators who deal with large volumes of coins daily. We understand the challenges of manual coin counting—it's time-consuming, prone to errors, and can be tedious. Peso Quanta automates this process, allowing business owners to focus more on growing their business and less on counting coins.<br>
                        <br>
                        Who We Serve We primarily serve pisonet and peso Wi-Fi business operators in rural and semi-urban areas across the Philippines. Many of these businesses lack access to costly counting machinery, which is why our solution is designed to work on a smartphone—making it accessible, affordable, and user-friendly.<br>
                        <br>
                        What We Do Peso Quanta is a mobile application that uses your phone's camera and advanced AI (powered by the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm) to automatically count and record Philippine peso coins (1-peso, 5-peso, 10-peso, and 20-peso coins). By simply taking a picture of the coins, the app will accurately detect, count, and record sales, helping you save time and avoid human errors.<br>
                        <br>
                        Our Values<br>
                        <br>
                        Innovation: We are committed to leveraging cutting-edge technology to deliver solutions that matter.<br>
                        Accessibility: We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or financial capacity.<br>
                        Reliability: We strive to ensure that our system is accurate, secure, and dependable, providing peace of mind to all our users.<br>
                        Our Vision To become the leading provider of affordable automation solutions for small business operators in rural areas, helping to bridge the technology gap and improve livelihoods.<br>
